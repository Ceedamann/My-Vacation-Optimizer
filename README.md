# My Vacation Optimizer

### Imagine being able to plan out your next vacation or adventure all in one place, no travel agent needed. Now you can! With My Vacation Optimizer!

### With My Vacation Optimizer you will be able to first (and most importantly) find out if the weather will be to your liking. From there you can take a small tour through a video of the location, or call one of the local tour guides for questions. Finally you can plan out the entire vacation right on our app!

## With **Mike** and **Carl** on the front end, and **Andre** and **Max** on the back end we were easly able to make the app not only spectaculary well, but also function without issues!

## Going through the app

On the first page you'll be greeted with an array of images, hit the Start an Adventure to be taken down to the form and begin looking into that next adventure!

Here you will need to fill out the form in order to check if around your adventure date you can match up a region with the temperature of your liking. If cities dont pop up, consider it being a type of weather you dont like.

On the Form
* Date: Select when your planning to go.
* Weather: What type of weather your looking for.
* Region: Where in the world do you wanna go?
